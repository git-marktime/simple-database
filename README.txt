IMPORTANT: i noticed that this thing likes to explode when running the list command, if that happens, make sure there is a file extension for every item in the parent directory

this code creates files under the same directory that the exe is in, because im still stupid at rust, 

so you will want to put the exe into its own folder

this is completely standalone, all you have to install is the exe, the main.rs is just to view the source code
